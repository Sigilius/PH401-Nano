## PH401-Nano

Nanotechnology Project done as part of the PH401 course

You can check out our deployed project [here](https://ph401-nano-d7ica39czktd8oswappjjgm.streamlit.app/)

## Tech Stack

* Python - Streamlit

## Question

Write a computer program to deduce the total number of atoms, surface atoms, volume atoms for FCC, SC and cuboctahedral/spherical shape. Plot % of atoms in bulk/surface and surface/bulk versus particle size. The user should get the idea to generate the thickness or size of nanoparticle for a particular application (optical/electrical/magnetic/strength)

## Implementation

### Inputs

* Shape (Cuboctahedral/Spherical/FCC/SC)
* Application (Optical/Electrical/Strength/Magnetic/Any Value)
* Range of size of nanoparticle (1nm to 100nm) 

### Output

* Table with values of bulk and surface atoms for each particular layer
* Graph that plots the surface atom % and bulk atom % versus particle sizes
* Graph that shows the relation between surface/bulk atom ratio versus particle sizes
